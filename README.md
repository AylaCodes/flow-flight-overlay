# Flight Overlay

This one is simple, displays flight information as a bar in realtime.
Intended for use by livestreamers.

## Installation

Simply copy the HTML/CSS/JS into a new script on Flow. and **replace {username} with your simbrief username** in the javascript file on line 27.

I will provide a community-folder installable package at a later time once I'm happy
with the state of the script.
