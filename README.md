# Flight Overlay

This one is simple, displays flight information as a bar in realtime.
Intended for use by livestreamers.

Note: Display with all options enabled may not display correctly on screen resolutions below 1080p. This is a conscious design decision to compromise between readability, and I firmly believe that VERY few people are running MSFS on screens lower than 1080p.

## Installation
