# Flight Overlay

This one is simple, displays flight information as a bar in realtime.
Intended for use by livestreamers.

Note: Display with all options enabled will not display correctly on screen resolutions below 1080p. This is a conscious design decision to compromise between readability, and I firmly believe that VERY few people are running MSFS on screens lower than 1080p.

## Installation

Simply copy the HTML/CSS/JS into a new script on Flow, and configure the settings in the panel.

I will provide a community-folder installable package at a later time once I'm happy
with the state of the script. (Coming soon!)

Also with the next update will include re-added SimBrief support and some bugfixes.
