# Flight Overlay

This one is simple, displays flight information as a bar in realtime.
Intended for use by livestreamers.

## Installation

Simply copy the HTML/CSS/JS into a new script on Flow, and configure the settings in the panel.

I will provide a community-folder installable package at a later time once I'm happy
with the state of the script. (Coming soon!)

Also with the next update will include re-added SimBrief support and some bugfixes.
